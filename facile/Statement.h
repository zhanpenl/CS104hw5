// This is the abstract Statement class, from which your various statement
// classes will need to extend.  There is only one method in the Statement
// class, an execute() method that executes the statement, making any
// necessary changes to the given ProgramState.

class Statement
{
	// execute() takes a ProgramState and executes this statement, by making
	// any necessary changes to the ProgramState (e.g. a new value for the
	// program counter, changing the value of some variable, pushing or
	// popping from the line number stack).
	
	// execute() also takes a ostream parameter;  if any output is to be  
	// written, write it to the given ostream.
	
	//
	// In the event that the execution of the statement causes a fatal error
	// that should terminate the Facile program, such as division by zero or
	// a RETURN statement without a corresponding GOSUB, the program may exit
	// instead of returning from execute().
